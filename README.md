# nfc_manager

A Flutter plugin for NFC which provides a high-level interface for interacting with the device's
NFC hardware.
You can find the Android implementation at [nfc_manager_android](nfc_manager_android/).
Since this package is
[endorsed]((https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/developing-packages#endorsed-federated-plugin)),
we can simply use [nfc_manager](nfc_manager) normally and these plugins will be automatically
included in your app when you do.
